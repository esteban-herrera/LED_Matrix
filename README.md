# LED Matrix
The goal of this project was to use a Raspberry Pi 2 to control an 8x8 LED Matrix to scroll messages across like a screen.
There was a lot of experimentation and iteration and this is an attempt to document it all.

The first step is to wire up the LED Matrix on a breadboard, identify the anode and cathode pins, and wire those to GPIO pins on the Pi. As shown in the picture below.

It's important to remember to use resistors in series with your LEDs.
